# This above route allows unrestricted file upload. 

# The following security measures to mitigate the vulnerability of unrestricted file upload in bullet point format:

# - Limit File Types: Allow only specific file types to be uploaded.
# - Validate File Size: Set a maximum file size limit for uploads.
# - Sanitize File Names: Remove potentially dangerous characters from file names.
# - Scan for Malicious Content: Implement file content scanning for malicious content detection.
# - Store Uploaded Files Securely: Store files outside the web root directory with proper permissions.
# - Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): Serve uploaded files through a CDN for added security.
# - Implement User Authentication and Authorization: Require authentication and restrict uploads to authorized users.
# - Monitor and Log Upload Activities: Log file upload activities for monitoring and detecting suspicious behavior.
